# LabView Sequence Editor

This tool was a custom program built to more quickly edit the "sequence" files in use at TDA Research. TDA used a custom built sequence system in LabView. This system had its own syntax and files. These files were typically edit in Notepad, but it became difficult to keep consistent references between the various files.

The editor uses the AvalonEdit package along with the AvalonDock for controlling edit panes.

This tool highlights the power of a relatively simple program which is tailored to the application at hand.
